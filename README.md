# OERC

... is a software project to locally store, view and search the program data of
public-law ("Ã¶ffentlich-rechtliche") TV stations in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

`oerc` needs a single PostgreSQL database and some configuration options to get ready.

While `oerc` is a command-line tool only, a built-in web application is provided for you
at `127.0.0.1:8080` (*default*) if you run `oerc server`.

### Commands

- **Collecting TV program data** of 28 TV channels (`oerc fetch`)
- **Search for interesting program** items by looking for your own keywords (`oerc search`)
- Running an **HTTP server** to access program data in a simple Web-UI (`oerc server`)
- By default, the server contains a small **client web application** for your browser to view the program data and
  your personal program recommendations

With the help of `oerc` you can build and use your own private TV program recommendation tool while ALL
information is processed and kept locally.

This project is written in Golang, and it is *AGPL v3* licensed. You are encouraged to participate and improve
functionality.
[Just create a GitHub issue!](https://github.com/emschu/oerc/issues)

The focus of this project lies in providing program data for individuals - ready to be enriched, searched or analysed
as long as there is no (real) Open Data policy of the public-law sector.

At the moment it's not intended to create links between program data and Media(thek) information.
If you are looking for this have a look at [similar projects](#similar-projects).

*Note 1:* This server and client software is not ready to be used directly in the internet without further changes.
It is recommended to use it locally only or in protected environments and don't expose it to the internet.

*Note 2*: Unfortunately the public-law web pages this software needs to access are restricted to certain geographic IP
regions in general.

**Current software quality: Beta**

# Setup & Run

## Download and start
Download the `oerc` binary from [here](https://github.com/emschu/oerc/releases) for your platform,
make it executable, and you are ready to start.

## With docker/docker-compose

Clone this repository, and build the binary file for the container:
```bash
$ CGO_ENABLED=0 ; GOOS=linux ; GO111MODULE=on go build -o bin/oerc-release -ldflags "-s -w"
```
Then:
```bash
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up
```

## Manual Installation

1. To obtain this application use the following command

```shell
go install github.com/emschu/oerc@latest
```

2. Set up a PostgreSQL database (12+), configure a database with a user and start it.
    - The development section contains a simple docker command to run a local database for development and
3. Run `oerc init`.   
   - This will copy a sample configuration file to the path `~/.oerc.yaml` - if the file does not exist already.
   You have to change some of the values in order to get `oerc` to work, at least you have to replace `<db_name>`,
   `<db_user>`, `<db_password>` in the configuration file to reach the database you've configured in the previous step.
4. Run `oerc fetch` for the first time and wait until the first program data is collected for you.
5. Run `oerc server` to have a browser application at `http://localhost:8080/client` (the endpoint is configurable).
6. Run `oerc search` to look for recommendations based on your self-defined keywords in the configuration.

### Configuration options

The following preferences are important to understand your possibilities to control this software.
You can find this file [here](./config/.oerc_default.dist.yaml) and if you run `oerc init` this file will be created at
`~/.oerc.yaml` for you. You *must* provide valid postgres database connection details.

If you don't want to put your configuration at the user's home directory, you can also use the
`-c <path-to-your-oerc>.yaml`
argument for all `oerc` commands.

```yaml
# db settings

```

## Usage

After installing `oerc` and setting it up, you should run at least one time the `oerc fetch` command.

It is recommended to update the program data regularly, e.g. daily, by using a (unix) **cron job** which
runs `oerc fetch`
and `oerc search`.

While it is possible to run `oerc server` in a user session, you should consider to create a systemd
service to run and control the web server (backend + frontend) in the background persistently.

The following systemd service file is a simple example to integrate `oerc` with systemd in a Linux system:

**oerc.service:**

```
[Unit]
Description=oerc service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=<path_to_oerc_bin> server
StandardOutput=journal
KillMode=process

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

*Note*: You *must* replace `<path_to_oerc_bin>` with an absolute path to the `oerc` binary (`which oerc`).

Copy the modified system service templates to your systemd services directory, e.g. `/etc/systemd/system`, and reload the
systemd daemon by executing

`$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload`.

After the last command you can use

`$ sudo systemctl [start|stop] oerc`

to start (or stop) the services.

To (not) start the service on boot, type

`$ sudo systemctl [enable|disable] oerc`.

If you enable both services by default, please keep in mind that the PostgreSQL database needs
to be available too, so ensure to enable the postgres database service as well.

## Project guidelines

- This project is non-commercial.
- Private/commercial sector TV or radio stations will *never* be part of this project.
- This project shall be an instrument mainly to analyze the program and constructively
  improve public-law TV and radio stations. Or just use it privately.
- This project would be superfluous, if there was a public API for public data, OpenData...
- Minimise traffic and external load to the least needed.
- Avoid security problems on the client side and maintain privacy of the users.
- All parts of the software should work on "low-resource" platforms, e.g. a Raspberry Pi 3b+

### OpenApi 3 specification

If you run the (backend) server (`oerc server`) an OpenApi 3 specification is shipped at
`http://localhost:8080/spec/openapi3.json`, respectively `.yaml`. Or have a look at the
API specification files in [this directory](./docs).
